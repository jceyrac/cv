Hi there!
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm Jérôme, a freelance product manager and this is my online CV. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I have more than 10 years of experience in digital product management, using Agile/Scrum, Lean and Design thinking  methodologies, mainly for companies in the Fintech industry.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
In my last assignment I managed products for Powens, the leading Open Banking platform in France. Before that I managed digital product and APIs in the home improvement industry and insurance industry but I also worked abroad in Madrid for one year and 3 years in London, managing products for startups in the Fintech, SMEs services and media industries.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Even though I can skill-fully manage the communication and marketing of a product, my biggest strength is in the definition of product road maps that best meets the stakeholders and clients needs and the ability to design and deliver complex technical solutions accordingly.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm currently living in Lille, north of France, but would be happy to work abroad if some remote work is possible. As a matter of fact, I’ve already worked in London, Madrid, Bruxelles and Paris.
</p>

Looking forward to having a chat!
