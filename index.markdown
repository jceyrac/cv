Hi there!
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm Jérôme, a freelance product manager and this is my online CV. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I have more than 10 years of experience managing SaaS digital products, using Agile/Scrum, Lean and Design thinking  methodologies, mainly for companies in the Fintech industry.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm specialized in the management of complex and technical products thanks to my engineering background and my experience as a J2EE developer. But as a UX Designer, I also build user centered products with great user experience.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm happy to work on products all over Europe as long as some days of remote work are possible.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Looking forward to having a chat!
