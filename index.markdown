Hi there!
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm Jérôme, a freelance product manager and this is my online CV. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I have more than 8 years of experience in digital product management as a freelancer, on products of the Fintech, B2B services and media industries.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I worked lately in France but also in Madrid for one year and 3 years in London, managing products for startups following the Lean startup and agile methodologies.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Even though I can skill-fully manage the communication and marking of a product, my biggest strength is in the design and delivery of complex technical products thanks to my technical background. Indeed, I have a Master's Degree in Engineering and strong experience in IT delivery with my years at Accenture working as a developer, project manager and business analyst.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
I'm currently living in Lille, north of France, but am looking for opportunities to work full remote or relocate in London (UK), Brussels (BE) or Zurich/Geneva (CH) if some remote work is possible.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Looking forward to having a chat!
